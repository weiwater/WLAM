# WLAM - Wasteload Allocation Model

The Wasteload Allocacation Model (WLAM) is a hydrologic simulation tool developed by Wildermuth Environmental Inc. (WEI). WEI began development of the computer simulation model in 1994 and has improved it over time to support several water resources investigations.
   
The origin of the model traces back to WEIâ€™s earlier work for the Chino Basin Water Conservation District (CBWCD) and the Chino Basin Watermaster (CBWM) in California. These agencies sought to estimate the storm water recharge in the Chino Basin that occurred in recharge basins, flood retention basins, and unlined streams. WEI developed daily simulation models (RUNOFF and ROUTER) to estimate runoff from daily rainfall, route the runoff through the Chino Basin drainage system, calculate recharge on a daily basis, and produce reports that summarized recharge performance. 

These models were initially developed for the western Chino Basin in 1994 (Mark J. Wildermuth, 1995) and were expanded to the entire Chino Basin in 1996 (WEI, 1998). Subsequently, the model was used in the Chino Basin to estimate the recharge performance for new basins and the recharge benefits of improved basin maintenance. The Phase 2 Chino Basin Recharge Master Plan (Black & Veatch, 2001) used the model results as a basis for recharge facility design and cost estimates. 

In 2001, WEI updated the model to include water quality simulations and expanded the modeling area to the entire Santa Ana River watershed for the wasteload allocation investigation (WEI, 2002) and renamed the model the Wasteload Allocation Model (WLAM). WLAM has been improved from the version applied in 2002.

The report (WLAM 2008 Complete Report.pdf) summarizes our efforts to update, calibrate, and apply the Wasteload Allocation Model to estimate projected TDS and Nitrate-N concentrations of the Santa Ana River recharge water and discharge at Prado Dam.
